Data Slicing Algorithm

This Python program is designed to process a user-provided text file, perform text preprocessing, generate slices based on file size, and identify disjoint slices using cosine similarity. If the file size exceeds a specified threshold, the program creates and saves disjoint slices into separate text files.

Prerequisites
Before running the program, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
scikit-learn
You can install the required packages by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install nltk scikit-learn
Additionally, download the NLTK stopwords dataset:

bash
Copy code
python -m nltk.downloader stopwords
Introduction
This program addresses the need to process large text documents efficiently by providing the following functionalities:

Text Preprocessing: The input text undergoes preprocessing, which includes tokenization, stemming using Porter's algorithm, and removal of English stopwords.

File Size Based Slicing: If the file size exceeds a specified threshold (max_size), the program divides the text into fixed-size slices. Otherwise, it processes the entire content as is.

Cosine Similarity for Disjoint Slices Detection: The program uses the cosine similarity metric to identify disjoint slices among the generated slices. Slices with a cosine similarity below a specified threshold (threshold) are considered disjoint.

User Interaction: The program prompts the user to enter the path to their text file and provides feedback based on the file size.

Usage
Clone the repository or download the script.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.

Run the script by executing the following command:
python script_name.py
Enter the path to your text file when prompted.

The program will display disjoint slices if the file size exceeds the standard size.

Customization
You can customize the program by adjusting the following parameters:
max_size: Set the standard size threshold for file slicing.
threshold: Set the cosine similarity threshold for identifying disjoint slices.
File Structure
script_name.py: The main Python script.

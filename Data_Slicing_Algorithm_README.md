## Prerequisites
Before you begin using the Data Slicing Algorithm, it is crucial to have a suitable environment. This program requires:
- **Python 3:** A powerful and versatile scripting language. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** A leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It's essential for text processing tasks.
- **scikit-learn:** A machine learning library for Python, utilized here for its cosine similarity capabilities.

To install these packages, run the following commands in your terminal:
```bash
pip install nltk scikit-learn
```

Furthermore, the NLTK stopwords dataset is a requisite. Download it using:
```bash
python -m nltk.downloader stopwords
```

## Introduction
The Data Slicing Algorithm is designed to tackle challenges in processing large text documents. Key functionalities include:
- **Text Preprocessing:** This crucial step involves cleaning and standardizing the text. Our preprocessing includes tokenization (breaking text into words or phrases), stemming (reducing words to their base form using Porter's algorithm), and the removal of English stopwords (common words that add little meaning to the text).
- **File Size Based Slicing:** For efficiently handling large files, our algorithm checks the file size. If it exceeds a pre-set threshold (max_size), the text is divided into smaller, manageable slices.
- **Cosine Similarity for Disjoint Slices Detection:** We employ cosine similarity, a metric used to determine how similar two documents are irrespective of their size, to identify disjoint slices in the text. This helps in ensuring the uniqueness and non-redundancy of text slices.

## Usage
To use this program:
1. Clone the repository or download the script from [source link].
2. Navigate to the script's directory in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the script with the following command:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```
4. You will be prompted to enter the path to your text file. The algorithm will then process the file and output results based on the file size.

## Customization
The algorithm is flexible and allows for customization of key parameters:
- `max_size`: Define the maximum file size threshold for initiating slicing. Adjust this based on your specific needs and the capabilities of your system.
- `threshold`: Set the cosine similarity threshold. This determines how the algorithm identifies disjoint slices. A lower threshold will consider more slices as disjoint.

## File Structure
The project consists of the following files:
- `script_name.py`: This is the main Python script containing all the logic for the algorithm.
- `README.md`: Provides a comprehensive overview of the project, including setup instructions, usage, and customization guidelines.
